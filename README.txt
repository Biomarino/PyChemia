pyMaterials Discovery
=====================

pyMaterialsDiscovery is a framework for discovery and design
of materials based on first principles calculations



pymatdis is organize in a set of modules:

crystal          : Geometric information about a crystal structure
dm               : Routines for datamining
dft              : DFT routines and platform-dependent instructions
gui              : Graphic User Interface
mhm              : Implementation of the Minimal Hopping Method
rep              : Report generation
soft             : Routines of soft-computing, such as genetic algorithms,
                   swarm algorithms and neural networks
symm             : Symmetry identification and operations
tasks            : Code independent set of instructions for achieve specific
                   tasks in ab-initio calculations
utils            : Basic utilities such as constants and periodic table info
web              : Web interface
