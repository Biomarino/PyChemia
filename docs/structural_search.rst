Structural Search on PyChemia
=============================

PyChemia is framework for materials discovery, more than just compute
DFT calculations for structures already present in databases such as ICSD,
PyChemia searches for new structures that could never have been syntetized
or reported.

To achieve its goal, PyChemia relies on a number of methods of structural
search such as minima hoping method, genetic algorithms and other population
based algorithms.

In this chapter we describe the main functionalities of PyChemia for structural
search.
